Twitter-Sentiment-Analysis
==========================

In this repository we keep some of the code used to learn about Sentiment Analysis on tweets.

The data-set is not inluded here but can be easily downloaded trough the [Sentipolc 2014 website] [twitterdata].

The resulting file `twitts.csv` should be saved inside the `data` folder for it to work.

Tech
-----
- Python 3.4
- NLTK (classifiers)
- NUMPY (to mae nltk a bit faster)
- Scykit-Learn (not yet, but needed to make things go at reasonable speed + visualization if needed)

This work is still in its early stages. Many changes to come.

Version
----

0.2 (Alpha)

Credits
--------
This is a list of some people who made great code on SA available for all of us, to learn and use.
I expect this to grow much, much bigger as I learn more.
